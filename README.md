# This is a future README for this project



# Environment setup

You can create a virtual environment for the script using venv.
```shell
python -m venv C:\path\to\new\virtual\environment
```

Or using conda.
```shell
conda create --name <my-env>
conda activate <my-env>
```

Included in the repository is a cross-platform environment.yml file, allowing to create a copy of the one used for this project. The environment name is given in the first line of the file.
```shell
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate wikipedia_scraper_env
conda env list #verify the environment was installed correctly
```
